\chapter{Introduction}

This document provides a detailed description of the algorithm used to evaluate the two-step RSB observables in the Bethe lattice spin glass. The approach to the problem, the detail of the mathematical procedures and each other information not strictly related to the computer implementation of the algorithm are reported in the main work.

The algorithm reported has been developed in C++.
